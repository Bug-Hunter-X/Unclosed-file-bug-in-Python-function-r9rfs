This repository contains a simple Python function that demonstrates an unclosed file bug.  The function `function_with_unclosed_file` opens a file for reading but fails to close it, which can lead to resource leaks and potential issues. The solution demonstrates how to close files properly using either `f.close()` or a context manager (`with open(...) as f`).  Ensure that files are always properly closed to prevent unexpected behavior and errors in your programs.
